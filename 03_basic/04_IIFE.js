// Immediately Invoke Function Expressions (IIFE)

(2nd) >> executed call of function

ðŸ”’ Why use IIFE?

>>> Keep your variables private so they donâ€™t mess up other parts of your code.
>>> Run some code right now and never again â€” like setting things up.
>>> Keep your stuff safe in a box, so it doesnâ€™t mix with other peopleâ€™s stuff.
*/

============================== Named IIFE ==============================================
( function chaicode()  { 
    // console.log(`DB connected Two`)
}) () >>> error because sometimes immediately invoke function don't knew where to stop >>>
    >>>> SOlution add ; at end
*/

( function chaicode1()  {
    console.log(`DB connected Two`)

// ========================= arrow function also use IIFE ==============================

( (name) => {
    console.log(`DB Connected Three: ${name}`)
} ) ("Jack"); // the problem is sometimes semi-colon(;)
